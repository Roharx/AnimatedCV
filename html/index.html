            <h2>Just passed my first semester final exam</h2>
            <p>It started with a very fun project where I have taken up the leading role. 
                All of the members were diligent and hard working so the project itself was a blast. 
                We have constructed a mixture of kanban and SCRUM which was surprisingly working quite well. 
                At the end of our project, we have taken a 15 minute test where we had to present it and explain what functions it had, why and what we would have done otherwise if we had more time.
                <br><br> Everyone passed the test so I could not be more proud of the team and I hope to work with them again in the future.
            </p>
